The Level Density Project

## Description: 
A centralized website for nuclear level density (NLD) data. The data available on the website has been sourced from different publications using various experimental techniques.

## Features:

1. Plotting: The website is equipped with plotting capabilities. Users can simply select a particular dataset(s) they would like to view. By default all the selected datasets are plotted on a single graph. However, that can be modified and the users can view each dataset on a separate graph (using the split/unsplit button).

2. Model Fitting: Currently, users can fit their selected datasets to the phenomenological constant temperature (CT) model or the back-shifted Fermi gas (BSFG) model.

3. Download CSV files: If the users would like to download their selected datasets for further analysis, they can download the datafiles, along with the figure, as a zip folder.
